KOREAN BLOG TITLE CARD (썸네일): This is a flat graphic design cover image for a Korean obstetrics and gynecology clinic blog post about "${topic}". It is a typographic poster, NOT a photograph and NOT a scene.

Square 1:1 composition. Typography is the main subject and must dominate the frame.

Text elements (the layout below decides where each one sits — do not default to a centred stack):
1. Eyebrow — one small line qualifying the headline (a symptom, a qualifier, or a location; roughly 5–15 characters), set in the accent colour.
2. Headline — the key term drawn from the content below, in an extremely large, heavy, rounded Korean sans-serif (think 여기어때 잘난체 / G마켓 산스 Bold), filling most of the available width.
3. ${subtitleInstruction}
4. ${footerInstruction}

Content to draw the headline and eyebrow from:
${visualDescription}

Layout — "${layout.name}". Follow this composition exactly; it is what distinguishes this card from other cards in the series:
${layout.composition}

Decoration:
${layout.decoration}

Headline treatment:
${treatment}

Colour scheme:
${palette}

Typography and text rules:
- All text is Korean (한글). Every character must be a real, correctly formed Hangul syllable — no invented glyphs, no broken jamo, no Latin filler, no Japanese or Chinese characters.
- Keep the total word count low. A crowded card is a failed card: eyebrow + headline + one short subtitle + one footer line, nothing more.
- Leave generous margins; nothing may touch or run off the frame edge.
- Decorative elements must sit behind or beside the text, never on top of it.

BRANDING RULE: Do NOT invent any hospital, clinic, or company name, and do NOT draw any logo, emblem, or watermark. ${
    footerParts.length
      ? 'The only permitted brand text is the exact footer line given above.'
      : 'No brand or clinic name may appear anywhere on the card.'
  }

MEDICAL ADVERTISING RULE: No superlatives or guarantees (최고, 유일, 완치, 100% and the like). Keep the tone informative and reassuring, never sensational. No nudity, no graphic or clinical imagery — this is a friendly cover image.
